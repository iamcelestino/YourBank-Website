## My process
When I built my first static website ( https://iamcelestino.github.io/lando-startup-landing-page/ ), I faced many problems like CSS code organization and debugging bacause I wrote all my CSS code in a single file. To mitigate all the  problems, I decided to learn SASS while I am building this website(6 pages website). SASS adds superpowers to CSS with Functions, partials, functions, mixins and more.it also has been fun because it's the first time I follow all the specifications from a FIGMA file. feeling professional😉👩🏾‍💻.
